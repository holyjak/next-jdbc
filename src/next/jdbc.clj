(ns next.jdbc
  "The public API of the next generation java.jdbc library.

  The basic building blocks are the `java.sql`/`javax.sql` classes:
  * `DataSource` -- something to get connections from,
  * `Connection` -- an active connection to the database,
  * `PreparedStatement` -- SQL and parameters combined, from a connection,

  and the following functions and a macro:
  * `get-datasource` -- given a hash map describing a database or a JDBC
      connection string, construct a `javax.sql.DataSource` and return it,
  * `get-connection` -- given a connectable, obtain a new `java.sql.Connection`
      from it and return that,
  * `plan` -- given a connectable and SQL + parameters or a statement,
      return a reducible that, when reduced will execute the SQL and consume
      the `ResultSet` produced,
  * `execute!` -- given a connectable and SQL + parameters or a statement,
      execute the SQL, consume the `ResultSet` produced, and return a vector
      of hash maps representing the rows (@1); this can be datafied to allow
      navigation of foreign keys into other tables (either by convention or
      via a schema definition),
  * `execute-one!` -- given a connectable and SQL + parameters or a statement,
      execute the SQL, consume the first row of the `ResultSet` produced, and
      return a hash map representing that row; this can be datafied to allow
      navigation of foreign keys into other tables (either by convention or
      via a schema definition),
  * `execute-batch!` -- given a `PreparedStatement` and groups of parameters,
      execute the statement in batch mode (via `.executeBatch`); given a
      connectable, a SQL string, and groups of parameters, create a new
      `PreparedStatement` from the SQL and execute it in batch mode.
  * `prepare` -- given a `Connection` and SQL + parameters, construct a new
      `PreparedStatement`; in general this should be used with `with-open`,
  * `transact` -- the functional implementation of `with-transaction`,
  * `with-transaction` -- execute a series of SQL operations within a transaction.

  @1 result sets are built, by default, as vectors of hash maps, containing
      qualified keywords as column names, but the row builder and result set
      builder machinery is open and alternatives are provided to produce
      unqualified keywords as column names, and to produce a vector the
      column names followed by vectors of column values for each row, and
      lower-case variants of each.

  The following options are supported wherever a `Connection` is created:
  * `:auto-commit` -- either `true` or `false`,
  * `:read-only` -- either `true` or `false`,
  * `:connection` -- a hash map of camelCase properties to set, via reflection,
      on the `Connection` object after it is created.

  The following options are supported wherever a `Statement` or
  `PreparedStatement` is created:
  * `:concurrency` -- `:read-only`, `:updatable`,
  * `:cursors` -- `:close`, `:hold`
  * `:fetch-size` -- the fetch size value,
  * `:max-rows` -- the maximum number of rows to return,
  * `:result-type` -- `:forward-only`, `:scroll-insensitive`, `:scroll-sensitive`,
  * `:timeout` -- the query timeout,
  * `:statement` -- a hash map of camelCase properties to set, via reflection,
      on the `Statement` or `PreparedStatement` object after it is created.

  In addition, wherever a `PreparedStatement` is created, you may specify:
  * `:return-keys` -- either `true` or a vector of key names to return."

(defn get-datasource
  "Given some sort of specification of a database, return a `DataSource`.

  A specification can be a JDBC URL string (which is passed to the JDBC
  driver as-is), or a hash map.

  For the hash map, there are two formats accepted:

  In the first format, these keys are required:
  * `:dbtype` -- a string indicating the type of the database
  * `:dbname` -- a string indicating the name of the database to be used

  The following optional keys are commonly used:
  * `:user` -- the username to authenticate with
  * `:password` -- the password to authenticate with
  * `:host` -- the hostname or IP address of the database (default: `127.0.0.1`);
      can be `:none` which means the host/port segment of the JDBC URL should
      be omitted entirely (for 'local' databases)
  * `:port` -- the port for the database connection (the default is database-
      specific -- see below)
  * `:classname` -- if you need to override the default for the `:dbtype`
      (or you want to use a database that next.jdbc does not know about!)

  The following optional keys can be used to control how JDBC URLs are
  assembled. This may be needed for `:dbtype` values that `next.jdbc`
  does not recognize:
  * `:dbname-separator` -- override the `/` or `:` that normally precedes
      the database name in the JDBC URL
  * `:host-prefix` -- override the `//` that normally precedes the IP
      address or hostname in the JDBC URL
  * `:property-separator` -- an optional string that can be used to override
      the separators used in `jdbc-url` for the properties (after the initial
      JDBC URL portion); by default `?` and `&` are used to build JDBC URLs
      with properties; for SQL Server drivers (both MS and jTDS)
      `:property-separator \";\"` is used

  In the second format, this key is required:
  * `:jdbcUrl` -- a JDBC URL string

  Any additional options provided will be passed to the JDBC driver's
  `.getConnection` call as a `java.util.Properties` structure.

  Database types supported (for `:dbtype`), and their defaults:
  * `derby` -- `org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver` -- also pass `:create true`
      if you want the database to be automatically created
  * `duckdb` -- `org.duckdb.DuckDBDriver` -- embedded database
  * `h2` -- `org.h2.Driver` -- for an on-disk database
  * `h2:mem` -- `org.h2.Driver` -- for an in-memory database
  * `hsqldb`, `hsql` -- `org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver`
  * `jtds:sqlserver`, `jtds` -- `net.sourceforge.jtds.jdbc.Driver` -- `1433`
  * `mariadb` -- `org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver` -- `3306`
  * `mysql` -- `com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver`, `com.mysql.jdbc.Driver` -- `3306`
  * `oracle:oci` -- `oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver` -- `1521`
  * `oracle:thin`, `oracle` -- `oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver` -- `1521`
  * `oracle:sid` -- `oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver` -- `1521` -- uses the legacy `:`
      separator for the database name but otherwise behaves like `oracle:thin`
  * `postgresql`, `postgres` -- `org.postgresql.Driver` -- `5432`
  * `pgsql` -- `com.impossibl.postgres.jdbc.PGDriver` -- no default port
  * `redshift` -- `com.amazon.redshift.jdbc.Driver` -- no default port
  * `sqlite` -- `org.sqlite.JDBC`
  * `sqlserver`, `mssql` -- `com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver` -- `1433`
  * `timesten:client` -- `com.timesten.jdbc.TimesTenClientDriver`
  * `timesten:direct` -- `com.timesten.jdbc.TimesTenDriver`

(defn plan
  "General SQL execution function (for working with result sets).

  Returns a reducible that, when reduced, runs the SQL and yields the result.
  The reducible is also foldable (in the `clojure.core.reducers` sense) but
  see the **Tips & Tricks** section of the documentation for some important
  caveats about that.

  Can be called on a `PreparedStatement`, a `Connection`, or something that can
  produce a `Connection` via a `DataSource`.

  Your reducing function can read columns by name (string or simple keyword)
  from each row of the underlying `ResultSet` without realizing the row as
  a Clojure hash map. `select-keys` can also be used without realizing the row.
  Operations that imply an actual Clojure data structure (such as `assoc`,
  `dissoc`, `seq`, `keys`, `vals`, etc) will realize the row into a hash map
  using the supplied `:builder-fn` (or `as-maps` by default).

  If your reducing function needs to produce a hash map without calling a
  function that implicitly realizes the row, you can call:

  `(next.jdbc.result-set/datafiable-row row connectable opts)`

  passing in the current row (passed to the reducing function), a `connectable`,
  and an `opts` hash map. These can be the same values that you passed to `plan`
  (or they can be different, depending on how you want the row to be built,
  and how you want any subsequent lazy navigation to be handled)."

(defn execute-batch!
  "Given a `PreparedStatement` and a vector containing parameter groups,
  i.e., a vector of vector of parameters, use `.addBatch` to add each group
  of parameters to the prepared statement (via `set-parameters`) and then
  call `.executeBatch`. A vector of update counts is returned.

  An options hash map may also be provided, containing `:batch-size` which
  determines how to partition the parameter groups for submission to the
  database. If omitted, all groups will be submitted as a single command.
  If you expect the update counts to be larger than `Integer/MAX_VALUE`,
  you can specify `:large true` and `.executeLargeBatch` will be called
  instead.

  Alternatively, given a connectable, a SQL string, a vector containing
  parameter groups, and an options hash map, create a new `PreparedStatement`
  (after possibly creating a new `Connection`), and execute the SQL with
  the specified parameter groups. That new `PreparedStatement` (and the
  new `Connection`, if created) will be closed automatically after use.

  By default, returns a Clojure vector of update counts. Some databases
  allow batch statements to also return generated keys and you can attempt that
  if you ensure the `PreparedStatement` is created with `:return-keys true`
  and you also provide `:return-generated-keys true` in the options passed
  to `execute-batch!`. Some databases will only return one generated key
  per batch, some return all the generated keys, some will throw an exception.
  If that is supported, `execute-batch!` will return a vector of hash maps
  containing the generated keys as fully-realized, datafiable result sets,
  whose content is database-dependent.

  May throw `java.sql.BatchUpdateException` if any part of the batch fails.
  You may be able to call `.getUpdateCounts` on that exception object to
  get more information about which parts succeeded and which failed.

  For additional caveats and database-specific options you may need, see:
  https://cljdoc.org/d/com.github.seancorfield/next.jdbc/CURRENT/doc/getting-started/prepared-statements#caveats
